This appeal has been filed against judgment dated 08.07.2014 of High\nCourt of Karnataka in Civil Revision No. 219 of 2014. The Civil Revision\nwas filed by the appellants against the judgment and order dated 27th May,\n2014 of vacation District Judge, Mangalore in Original Suit No. 5 of 2014\nfiled by the appellants/plaintiffs. In the Suit, I.A. No. IV was filed by\nthe defendants/respondents under Section 8(1) of Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996, relying on arbitration agreement in retirement deed\ndated 25.07.2005(hereinafter referred to as retirement deed) as well as in\nthe partnership deed dated 05.04.2006(hereinafter referred to as\npartnership deed). Learned District Judge has allowed the application filed\nby the defendant under Section 8(1) of 1996 Act. Parties to the suit were\nreferred to the arbitration to settle the dispute as per arbitration\nagreement. The High Court wide impugned judgment has affirmed the order of\nTrial Court with observation that parties can press for an early trial. The\nRevision Petition was disposed of accordingly. Aggrieved against the\njudgment of High Court, the appellants/plaintiffs have filed this appeal.\n\n3. The brief facts necessary to be noted for deciding this appeal are:\n (i) Late Ramabhakta had started a business of manufacture and\nsales of 'Beedi' under the name 'M/s Neo Subhash Beedi Works'. After his\ndemise, his six sons, namely, late M. Narasimha Bhakta, late M.\nSubhaschandra Bhakta, late M. Prakashchandra Bhakta, late M. Ganesh\nBhakta, late M. Gangadhar Bhakta and late M. Ashok Bhakta, constituted\nthe partnership firm.\n\n(ii) M. Narsimha Bhakta retired from the firm as per the release deed dated\n30.06.1986 and the remaining partners continued with the firm.\n\n(iii) M.Prakashchandra Bhakta died on 20.03.1995 and as per his Will, his\nminor son Master M. Vinayaka Bhakta was admitted to the partnership as per\npartnership deed dated 21.03.1995. On 06.03.1997, Subhaschandra Bhakta died\nand his LRs, namely Defendant Nos. 1 to 4 became partners. Ashok Bhakta\ndied on 18.09.2001. The first plaintiff is son of late Ashok Bhakta.\n\n(iv) On 25.07.2005, retirement deed was executed in which\nDefendant Nos. 1 to 4 were stated to have retired from partnership. The\npartnership deed dated 05.04.2006 was entered between late M. Gangadhar\nBhakta, M. Vinayaka Bhakta, Defendant No. 5 and M. Vipin Bhakta(S/o late M.\nGanesh Bhakta) and Master M. Anantesh Bhakta,1st Plaintiff. M.Gangadhar\nBhakta expired and his estate is represented by the Plaintiff\nNos. 2 & 3.\n\n4. The suit for partition was filed by M. Prakaschandra Bhakta\nand others against M. Subhaschandra Bhakta and others, being O.S. NO. 4 of\n1985. The preliminary decree was passed on 31.07.1986. M. Subhaschandra\nBhakta and others filed FDP No. 24 of 1992 for preparation of final decree\nin which the compromise petition dated 04.04.1994 was filed and compromise\ndecree was passed on 05.04.1994. As per the compromise decree, Item No. 1\nof 'A' schedule property was allotted to M. Subhaschandra Bhakta and Item\nNo. 2 was allotted to M. Prakashchandra Bhakta.\n\n5. An agreement to sale dated 19.04.1993 was executed by M.\nPrakashchandra Bhakta in favour of partnership firm. Similar agreement to\nsell dated 19.04.1993 was also executed by M.Subhaschandra Bhakta in favour\nof firm.\n\n6. A Suit No. 5 of 2014 was filed by three Plaintiffs (appellants)\nagainst six Defendants who are Respondent Nos. 1 to 6 in this appeal\npraying for permanent prohibitory injunction restraining the Defendants or\nanyone claiming through them for transferring or alienating 'A' schedule\nproperty. Further, the permanent prohibitory injunction was sought against\nthe Defendant regarding possession and enjoyment of property by Plaintiff.\nThe Defendant had filed I.A.No.IV under Section 8(1) of Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as Act) on 09.05.2014,\npraying to pass an order referring the parties to the arbitration for\nadjudication of the disputes raised by the Plaintiff in the Suit. The\napplication was not accompanied by retirement deed and partnership deed.\n\n7. On 12.05.2014, the original retirement deed and the partnership deed\nwere produced by the Defendant along with the list. The counter affidavit\nto the application I.A. No. IV was also filed by the Plaintiff. The\nLearned District Judge heard the I.A.No.IV as well as the objections raised\nby the Plaintiff and by an order dated 27.05.2014, pass the following\norder:\n \u201cI.A.No. IV filed under Section 8(1) of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 by the defendants is allowed.\n The parties to the suit are referred to the Arbitration to settle\ntheir disputes and differences, in view of the Arbitration Agreement.\n The suit of the plaintiffs stands disposed off accordingly.\u201d\n\n\n8. Learned Counsel appearing for appellants in support of this appeal\nraised following submissions:\n(i) The application I.A.No.IV of 2014 praying for referring the matter to\narbitration was not accompanied by the original retirement deed dated\n25.07.2005 and partnership deed dated 05.04.2006, hence the application was\nliable to be dismissed under Section 8(2) and Learned District Judge\ncommitted error in allowing the application. According to Section 8(2) of\nthe Act, it is mandatory to file the original arbitration agreement or a\nduly certified copy thereof along with the application seeking reference to\nthe arbitration.\n\n(ii) All the parties to the suit were not parties to the arbitration\nagreement as claimed in retirement deed and partnership deed. Hence,\ndispute could not have been refereed to the arbitrator.\n\n(iii) The firm being an unregistered firm, no reference to the arbitration\ncan be made with regard to the dispute relating to unregistered firm.\n\n9. Learned counsel appearing for respondents have refuted the\nsubmissions and contends that Learned District Judge after considering all\naspects of the matter have rightly made the reference to the arbitrator. It\nis submitted that there was clear arbitration agreement in the retirement\ndeed as well as in the partnership deed as has been noted by District Judge\nand the suit could not have proceeded. All the Plaintiffs as well as\nDefendant Nos. 1 to 4 and Defendant No. 5 were parties to the arbitration\nagreement either personally or claiming through the person who was party to\nthe agreement. The Defendant No. 6 has not inherited any right in the\npartnership firm and was unnecessarily impleaded by the Plaintiff. Mere\npresence of Defendant No.6 as one of the Defendants does not preclude the\nimplementation of arbitration agreement. With regard to non-filing of\nretirement deed and partnership deed along with application I.A.No. IV of\n2014, two submissions have been raised. Firstly, it is contended that the\nPlaintiff themselves has filed both retirement deed and partnership deed\nalong with the list of documents and having admitted both retirement deed\nand partnership deed, non-filing along with the application I.A.No. IV was\ninconsequential. Secondly, the Defendant themselves immediately after three\ndays of filing their I.A.No. IV of 2014 had filed the original retirement\ndeed and partnership deed on 12.05.2014 and at the time the matter was\nconsidered by District Judge, original deeds were on the record. Hence, the\napplication I.A.No. IV was not liable to be rejected on this ground. There\nis no such provision which prohibits the adjudication of dispute by\narbitration regarding an unregistered partnership firm.\n10. We have considered the submissions of learned counsel for the parties\nand perused the records.\n\n11. From the pleadings on records and submissions made, following three\nissues arises for consideration:\n(1) Whether non-filing of either original or certified copy of retirement\ndeed and partnership deed along with application I.A.No. IV dated\n09.05.2014 entailed dismissal of the application as per section 8(2) of\n1996 Act.\n\n(2) Whether the fact that all the parties to the suit being not parties\nto the retirement deed/partnership deed, the Court was not entitled to make\nthe reference relying on arbitration agreement.\n\n(3) Whether dispute pertaining to unregistered partnership deed cannot be\nreferred to an arbitration despite there being arbitration agreement in the\ndeed of retirement/partnership deed.\n\nISSUE NO.(1)\n\n12. Two facts which emerged from record in this respect need to be noted.\nFirstly, the plaintiffs in their plaint of O.S.No. 5 of 2014 have referred\nto and admitted the retirement deed dated 25.07.2005 and partnership deed\ndated 05.04.2006 in para 5 of the plaint. The plaintiffs themselves have\nfiled the photocopies of deed of retirement dated 25.07.2005 as the\ndocument no. 6 in the list and photocopies of partnership deed dated\n05.04..2006 as document no. 7 as have been noted in para 23 of the District\nJudge judgment.\n\n Further, although initially the application filed by Defendant\nI.A.No. IV dated 09.05.2014 was not accompanied by copy of retirement deed\nand partnership deed. The Defendant on 12.05.2014 filed the original\nretirement deed and partnership deed along with the list. It is useful to\nnote the findings recorded by District Judge in the above context in\nparagraph 39 which is to the following effect:\n"39. The materials on record clearly goes to show that I.A.No. IV was\nfiled by the defendants on 09.05.2014. It is true that the application was\nnot accompanied by the Retirement Deed and the Partnership Deed either the\noriginals or the certified copies. On 12.05.2014 the original Retirement\nDeed and the Partnership Deed were produced by the defendants along with\nthe list."\n\n\n13. Section 8 which falls for consideration in the present case provides as\nfollows:\n" 8. Power to refer parties to arbitration where there is an arbitration\nagreement-\n(1) A judicial authority before which an action is brought in a matter\nwhich is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so\napplies not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance\nof the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration.\n(2) The application referred to in sub-section (1) shall not be\nentertained unless it is accompanied by the original arbitration agreement\nor a duly certified copy thereof.\n(3) Notwithstanding that an application has been made under sub-section\n(1) and that the issue is pending before the judicial authority, an\narbitration may be commenced or continued and an arbitral award made."\n\n\n14. The appellants submit that sub-section (2) of Section (8) provides\nthat "the application referred to in sub-section (1) shall not be\nentertained unless it is accompanied by the original arbitration agreement\nor a duly certified copy thereof." They submit that admittedly with the\napplication I.A.No. IV filed on 09.05.2014, original or certified copy of\nthe Retirement Deed and Partnership Deed was not filed.\n15. Learned Counsel to the appellants also placed reliance on a judgment\nof this court reported in 2008 (2) SCC 602, Atul Singh & Othes Vs. Sunil\nKumar Singh & Others. In the above case, defendant had moved a petition on\n28.02.2005 praying for referring the dispute to arbitration. The Trial\nCourt had dismissed the petition on the ground that the predecessor in\ninterest of the plaintiff was not party to the Partnership Deed executed on\n17.02.1992. Hence the main relief being declaration of the deed to be void\nwhich could have been granted only by the Civil Court, the dispute could\nnot be referred. Defendant filed Civil Revision which was allowed by the\nHigh Court. One of the submissions made before this court was that as per\nsub-section (2) of Section (8), the application could not have entertained\nunless it was accompanied by original arbitration agreement or duly\ncertified copy thereof. This court held that there is no whisper in the\npetition that the original agreement or a duly certified copy is being\nfiled. There was non compliance of Section 8(2). Hence the reference could\nnot have been made. Following was stated by this court in paragraph 19:\n" 19. There is no whisper in the petition dated 28.02.2005 that the\noriginal arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof is being\nfiled along with the application. Therefore, there was a clear non-\ncompliance with sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the 1996 Act which is a\nmandatory provision and the dispute could not have been referred to\narbitration. Learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that a copy\nof partnership deed was on the record of the case. However, in order to\nsatisfy the requirement of sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the Act,\nDefendant 3 should have filed the original arbitration agreement or a duly\ncertified copy thereof along with the petition filed by him on 28.02.2005,\nwhich he did not do. Therefore, no order for referring the dispute to\narbitration could have been passed in the suit."\n\n\n It is relevant to note that in Atul Singh's case (Supra), the\nsubmission of respondent was noticed that the copy of the Partnership Deed\nwas on the record of the case, but the Court has not proceeded to examine\nas to when such copies are already on record what is the effect.\n\n16. In this context, the reference is made to judgment of this Court in\n2007 (7) SCC 737, Bharat Sewa Sansthan Vs. U.P.Electronics Corporation Ltd.\n\n\n In the above case, two judge bench of this Court has held that\nphotocopies of lease agreement could be taken on record under Section 8 for\nascertaining the existence of arbitration clause. Following was stated in\nparagraph 24:\n"24. The respondent Corporation placed on record of the trial court\nphotocopies of the agreements along with an application under Section 8(1)\nof the Arbitration Act. The High Court, in our view, has rightly held that\nthe photocopies of the lease agreements could be taken on record under\nSection 8 of the Arbitration Act for ascertaining the existence of\narbitration clause. Thus, the dispute raised by the appellant Sansthan\nagainst the respondent Corporation in terms of the arbitration clause\ncontained in the lease agreement is arbitral."\n\n\n In the case of Atul Singh (Supra), which was also a judgment of two\nJudge Bench, earlier judgment in Bharat Sewa Sansthan was not cited.\nHowever, for purposes of this case, we need not enter into the issue as to\nwhether there is a compliance of section 8(2) if photocopies of the\narbitration agreement is already on the record and not disputed by the\nparties.\n\n17. There is one another aspect of the matter which is sufficient to\nuphold the order of the District Judge. Section 8(2) uses the phrase "shall\nnot be entertained". Thus, what is prohibited is the entertainment of the\napplication unless it is accompanied by the original arbitration agreement\nor a duly certified copy thereof.\n\n18. The word 'entertained' has specific meaning in P. Ramanatha Aiyar's\nAdvanced Law Lexicon word 'entertained' has been defined as:\n" 1. To bear in mind or consider, esp, to give judicial consideration to\n(the Court then entertained motions for continuance).\n2. To amuse or please.\n3. To receive(a person) as a guest or provide hospitality to (a person).\n The expression 'entertain' means to 'admit a thing for consideration'\nand when a suit or proceeding is not thrown out in limine but the Court\nreceives it for consideration and disposal according to law it must be\nregarded as entertaining the suit or proceeding, no matter whatever the\nultimate decision might be."\n\n\n The Blacks Law Dictionary also defines this word 'entertain' as\nfollows:\n"To bear in mind or consider;esp., to give judicial consideration to <the\ncourt then entertained motions for continuance>"\n\n\n19. In 1971 (3) SCC 124, Hindusthan Commercial Bank Ltd. Vs. Punnu Sahu\n(Dead) through Legal Representatives, the word 'entertained' came for\nconsideration as occurring in Order 21, Rule 90, Proviso of Civil procedure\nCourt. Para 2 of the Judgment notices the amended Proviso which was to the\nfollowing effect:\n"2. The amended proviso with which we are concerned in this appeal reads\nthus:\n'Provided that no application to set aside a sale shall be entertained-\n(a) upon any ground which could have been taken by the applicant on or\nbefore the date on which the sale proclamation was drawn up; and\n(b) Unless the applicant deposits such amount not exceeding twelve and half\npercent of the sum realised by the sale or furnishes such security as the\nCourt may, in its discretion, fix except when the Court for reasons to be\nrecorded dispense with the requirements of this clause:\n Provided further that no sale shall be set aside on the ground of\nirregularity or fraud unless upon the facts proved the Court is satisfied\nthat the applicant has sustained substantial injury by reason of such\nirregularity or fraud."\n\n\n The contention of the appellant was that word 'entertain' refers to\ninitiation of the proceedings and not to the stage when the Court takes up\nthe application for consideration. The High Court had rejected the said\ncontention. The above view of the High Court was approved by this court in\nparagraph 4 of the judgment. Following was stated:\n"4. Before the High Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant and\nthat contention was repeated in this court, that Clause (b) of the proviso\ndid not govern the present proceedings as the application in question had\nbeen filed several months before that clause was added to the proviso. It\nis the contention of the appellant that the expression 'entertain' found in\nthe proviso refers to the initiation of the proceedings and not to the sage\nwhen the Court takes up the application for consideration. This contention\nwas rejected by the High Court relying on the decision of that Court in\nKundan Lal Vs. Jagan Nath Sharma, AIR 1962 All 547. The sameview had been\ntaken by the said High Court in Dhoom Chand Jain V. Chamanlal Gupta, AIR\n1962 All 543 and Haji Rahim Bux and Sons V. Firm Samiullah and Sons, AIR\n1963 All 320 and again in Mahavir Singh V. Gauri Shankar, AIR 1964 All 289.\nThese decisions have interpreted the expression 'entertain' as meaning\n'adjudicate upon' or 'proceed to consider on merits'. This view of the High\nCourt has been accepted as correct by this Court in Lakshmiratan\nEngineering Works Ltd. V. Asst. Comm., Sales tax, Kanpur, AIR 1968 SC 488.\nWe are bound by that decision and as such we are unable to accept the\ncontention of the appellant that Clause (b) of the proviso did not apply to\nthe present proceedings."\n\n20. Another relevant judgment is 1998 (1) SCC 732, Martin and Harris\nLtd. Vs. VIth Additional District Judge and others. In the above case\nSection 21(1) proviso of U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent\nand Eviction) Act, 1972 (13 of 1972) word 'entertained' came for\nconsideration. The proviso to Section 21(1) was to the following effect:\n\n" 8. Provided that where the building was in the occupation of a tenant\nsince before its purchase by the landlord, such purchase being made after\nthe commencement of the Act, no application shall be entertained on the\ngrounds, mentioned in clause(a) unless a period of three years has elapsed\nsince the date of such purchase and the landlord has given a notice in that\nbehalf to the tenant not less than six months before such application, and\nsuch notice may be given even before the expiration of the aforesaid period\nof three years."\n\n\n In the above case, the application under Section 21(1) was filed by\nthe landlord before expiry of period of three years from the date of\npurchase. It was held by this Court that word 'entertained' as employed in\nfirst proviso under Section 21(1) could not mean 'institution' of such\nproceedings. In Para 9 and 10, following was laid down:\n"9. Even that apart there is an internal indication in the first proviso\nto Section 21(1) that the legislature has made a clear distinction between\n'entertaining' of an application for possession under Section 21(1)(a) of\nthe Act and 'filing' of such application. So far as the filing of such\napplication is concerned it is clearly indicated by the legislature that\nsuch application cannot be filed before expiry of six months from the date\non which notice is given by the landlord to the tenant seeking eviction\nunder Section 21(1)(a) of the Act. The words, "the landlord has given a\nnotice in that behalf to the tenant not less than six months before such\napplication", would naturally mean that before filing of such application\nor moving of such application before the prescribed authority notice must\nhave preceded by at least six months. Similar terminology is not employed\nby the legislature in the very same proviso so far as three years' period\nfor entertaining such application on the grounds mentioned in clause (a) of\nSection 21(1) a stage must be reached when the court applied its judicial\nmind and takes up the case for decision on merits concerning the grounds\nfor possession mentioned in clause (a) of Section 21(1) of the Act.\nConsequently on the very scheme of this Act it cannot be said that the word\n'entertain' as employed by the legislature in the first proviso to Section\n21(1) of the Act would at least mean taking cognizance of such an\napplication by the prescribed authority by issuing summons for appearance\nto the tenant-defendant. It must be held that on the contrary the term\n'entertain' would only show that by the time the application for possession\non the grounds mentioned in clause (a) of Section 21(1) is taken up by the\nprescribed authority for consideration on merits, atleast minimum three\nyears' period should have elapsed since the date of purchase of the\npremises by the landlord.\n\n10. Leaned Senior Counsel, Shri Rao, for the appellant then invited our\nattention to two decisions of this Court in the case of Lakshmiratan\nEngineering Works Ltd. V. Asstt. Commr.(Judicial) I, Sales Tax and\nHindusthan Commercial bank Ltd V. Punnu Sahu. In Lakshmiratan Engineering\nthis Court was concerned with the meaning of the word 'entertain' mentioned\nin the proviso to Section 9 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948.\nHidayatullah,J., speaking for the Court observed in the light of the\nstatutory scheme of Section 9 of the said Act that the direction to the\nCourt in the proviso to Section 9 was to the effect that the Court shall\nnot proceed to admit to consideration an appeal which is not accompanied by\nsatisfactory proof of the payment of the admitted tax. In the case of\nHindusthan Commercial Bank the term 'entertain' as found in the proviso to\nOrder XXI Rule 90 Code of Civil Procedure(CPC) fell for consideration of\nthe Court. Hegde,J., speaking for a Bench of two learned Judges of this\nCourt in this connection observed that the term 'entertain' in the said\nprovision means 'to adjudicate upon' or 'to proceed to consider on merits'\nand did not mean 'initiation of proceeding '. The aforesaid decisions, in\nour view, clearly show that when the question of entertaining an\napplication for giving relief to a party arises and when such application\nis based on any grounds on which such application has to be considered, the\nprovision regarding 'entertaining such application' on any of these grounds\nwould necessarily mean the consideration of the application on the merits\nof the grounds on which it is base. In the present case, therefore, it must\nbe held that when the legislature has provided that no application under\nSection 21(1)(a) of the Act shall be entertained by the prescribed\nauthority on grounds mentioned in clause (a) of Section 21(1) of the Act\nbefore expiry of three years from date of purchase of property by the\nlandlord it must necessarily mean consideration by the prescribed authority\nof the grounds mentioned in clause (a) of Section 21(1) of the Act on\nmerits."\n\n\n21. In the present case as noted above, the original Retirement Deed and\nPartnership Deed were filed by the defendants on 12th May and it is only\nafter filing of original deeds that Court proceeded to decide the\napplication I.A.No. IV.\n\n22. Section 8(2) has to be interpreted to mean that the court shall not\nconsider any application filed by the party under Section 8(1) unless it is\naccompanied by original arbitration agreement or duly certified copy\nthereof. The filing of the application without such original or certified\ncopy, but bringing original arbitration agreement on record at the time\nwhen the Court is considering the application shall not entail rejection of\nthe application under Section 8(2).\n\n23. In the present case it is relevant to note the Retirement Deed and\nPartnership Deed have also been relied by the plaintiffs. Hence, the\nargument of plaintiffs that defendants' application I.A.No. IV was not\naccompanied by original deeds, hence, liable to be rejected, cannot be\naccepted. We are thus of the view that the appellants submission that the\napplication of defendants under Section 8 was liable to be rejected, cannot\nbe accepted.\n\nISSUE NO. 2\n\n24. The relevant facts and pleadings of the parties have been marshaled\nby the trial court. Trial Court has returned the findings that the\nplaintiff no. 1 represented by his mother and next friend was party to the\nRetirement Deed. The mother of plaintiff namely Smt. Usha A. Bhakta has\nsigned the retirement deed for self and on behalf of her minor children,\nthe plaintiff No. 1. Plaintiff No. 2 and 3 claiming their rights through\none of the partners Shri Gangadhar Bhakta, their father, who was party to\nthe retirement deed. In paragraph 23 of the judgment, Learned District\nJudge had returned the following findings:\n"...therefore, the plaintiff no. 1 represented by his mother and next\nfriend Smt. Usha A. Bhakta is a party to the Retirement Deed and plaintiffs\n2 and 3 are claiming their rights through one of the partner late Shri\nGangadhar Bhakta, who was also a party to the Retirement Deed. The\nDefendants 1 to 5 are also the parties to this Retirement Deed. Therefore,\nexcept defendant No. 6 all others are either personally or through the\npersons from whom they are claiming the right are parties to the Deed of\nRetirement Deed dated 25.07.2005..."\n\n\n Thus it was only defendant no. 6 who was not party to the retirement\ndeed or partnership deed. Both 5th and 6th defendants are issues of late M.\nPrakashchandra Bhakta.\n\n25. Learned Counsel for the respondents have submitted that it was case\nof the plaintiffs themselves that by virtue of Will executed by\nM.Prakashchandra Bhakta it was only defendant no. 5 who became entitled to\nbenefits of partnership and defendant no. 6 was not given any share.\n\n26. The plaintiffs admittedly are parties to the arbitration agreement as\nnoted above. It does not lie in their mouth to contend that since one of\nthe defendants whom they have impleaded was not party to the arbitration\nagreement, no reference can be made to the arbitrator. In the facts of the\npresent case, it cannot be said that merely because one of the defendants\ni.e. defendant no. 6 was not party to the arbitration agreement, the\ndispute between the parties which essentially relates to the benefits\narising out of Retirement Deed and Partnership deed cannot be referred.\n\n27. Learned District Judge has noted that defendant no.6 has not\ninherited any share either in Partnership deed or in the schedule property\nand hence there is no question of bifurcation of either cause of action or\nparties. Relevant findings in this context have been returned by District\nJudge in paragraph 40 to the following effect:\n\u201c40...It is only defendant No. 6 was not the party to either the Retirement\nDeed or the Partnership Deed where there is an Arbitration Clause to refer\nall the disputes and differences to the Arbitration. Even according to the\nplaintiffs defendant No. 6 is not a Partner nor she is a party to any of\nthe documents and further as per the Will executed by her father late Shri\nPrakash Chandra Baktha, she has not inherited any right or share either in\nthe Partnership Deed or in the Schedule property. Moreover, the Plaint\nschedule property according to the plaintiffs is the property of the\nPartnership Firm M/s. 'Neo Subhash Beedi Works'. Therefore, there is no\nquestion of bifurcation of either cause of action or parties if the same is\nto be referred to the Arbitration as per the Arbitration Clause formed in\nthe Retirement Deed dated: 25.07.2005 and the Partnership Deed dated\n05.04.2006...\u201d\n\n\n We fully endorse the above view taken by Learned District Judge.\n\nISSUE NO. 3\n28. The submission by the petitioner is that partnership being an\nunregistered partnership, no reference can be made to the arbitration. In\nthe present case there is no dispute between the parties that both\nRetirement deed and Partnership deed contain an arbitration clause. In\nRetirement deed which had been signed by retiring partners, continuing\npartners and concurring partners, following was stated in clause 8:\n\u201c...In case of any dispute or difference arising between the parties,\nregarding the interpretation of the contents of this Deed of Retirement or\nany other matter or transactions touching the said retirement, it shall be\nreferred to an arbitration under the provisions of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996...\u201d\n\n\n Further, in partnership deed which was 05.04.2006, clause 26 contains\nan arbitration clause which is to the following effect:\n\n\u201c 26. ALL DISPUTES arising between the partners or their legal\nrepresentatives about the interpretation of this Deed or their rights and\nliabilities there under or in relation to any other matters whatsoever\ntouching the partnership affairs shall be decided by an Arbitration as\nprovided by the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996.\u201d\n\n When the partners and those who claim through partners agreed\nto get the dispute settled by arbitration, it is not open for the\nappellants to contend that partnership being unregistered partnership, the\ndispute cannot be referred.\n\n29. The petitioners have not been able to show any statutory provision\neither in 1996 Act or in any other statute from which it can be said that\ndispute concerning unregistered partnership deed cannot be referred to\narbitration. We thus do not find any substance in the third submission of\nthe appellant.\n\n30. In the result, we do not find any merit in this appeal which is\naccordingly dismissed.\n\n\n ...........................J.\n (R.K.
